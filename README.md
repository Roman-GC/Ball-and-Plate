# Ball-and-Plate
Ball and plate project done with TI RM42

Unfortunately, I couldn't find all the files related to this project. However, everything necessary to complete it is in the bibliography of the attached PDF.

I hope this is useful in some way. Don't forget to give credit; it's not necessary, but it would be nice.
